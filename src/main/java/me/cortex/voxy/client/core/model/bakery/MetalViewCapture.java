/**
 * M13 chunk 1 (2026-05-13): Metal-side counterpart to {@link GlViewCapture}.
 * Owns the 48×32 Shared-storage Metal bake target, the
 * {@link MetalBudgetBufferRenderer}, and the {@link AtlasMirror} that lifts
 * MC's GL atlas onto Metal. Exposes the same API shape
 * ({@link #emitToStream}) so {@link ModelTextureBakery} can dispatch to
 * either GL or Metal at run-time without per-pixel format conversion in
 * the caller.
 *
 * <p>Per-bake flow used by {@code renderToStreamMetal}:
 * <pre>
 *   capture.beginBake(mcAtlasGlId, meshAddr, quadCount);
 *   for (int face = 0; face &lt; 6; face++) {
 *       capture.renderFace(face%3, face/3, matrix);
 *   }
 *   capture.endBake();           // ends pass + submit + GPU wait
 *   capture.emitToStream(dest);  // CPU read + pack into uvec2-per-pixel
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Output format matches {@link GlViewCapture#emitToStream} pixel-for-pixel
 * so {@code ModelStore} consumers don't need to branch on backend:
 * <pre>
 *   outA[0..3] = packed RGBA (little-endian: R at lowest byte)
 *   outA[4..7] = (depthBits &lt;&lt; 8) | (tintBit &lt;&lt; 7)
 * </pre>
 * The MVP doesn't write a metadata attachment (single RGBA8 colour target
 * only), so the second uvec2 component is zero — depth-test-driven downstream
 * features (e.g. alpha-discard variant flags) are lost in this round. Real
 * RGBA colour pixels DO flow through, which is the big visual win versus the
 * VOXY_NO_ATLAS hash-colour placeholder.
 *
 * <p>The single-attachment shape sidesteps a Metal-side
 * {@code RenderPassDesc.colorAttachment(N, ...)} multi-binding investigation
 * — the bakery's MVP can ship without it, and a follow-up can swap to a
 * two-attachment variant once we verify the descriptor supports it on Metal.
